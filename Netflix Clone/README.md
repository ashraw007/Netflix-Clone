# Netflix Clone

Here we created a netflix clone from react and redux. Some of the tools used include: <br />

- Hooks (and custom hooks)
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- Context API
- Responsive web design
- Cypress end-to-end testing

<br />

It is a work in progress, we will include new features in futures. <br />

The future of this project: <br />

- Integrate it with a mongoDB backend
- Create an authentication flow
